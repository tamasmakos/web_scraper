Web Scraping Articles from Nature.com

This Python script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape articles from nature.com based on user inputs of the number of pages to scrape and the type of articles to fetch.


How It Works

The user is asked to provide the number of pages to be scraped and the type of articles to fetch. The script then sends HTTP requests to fetch the pages and parses the HTML responses.

The script retrieves articles of the specified type from each page, extracting the article link, header, teaser, and body. It then saves each article as a separate text file in a directory named "Page_N", where N is the page number.

If an article type is not found on a page or an error occurs while fetching an article, the script simply moves on to the next page.

The script maintains a list of all saved articles, which it prints out once all the pages have been scraped.

Usage

Before running the script, ensure that you have installed the required libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, os, and string. You can install these using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Then, you can simply run the script in a Python environment. When prompted, provide the number of pages to scrape and the type of articles to fetch.

Future Improvements

Currently, the script only supports articles of type "Article" and "Research Highlight". In the future, support could be added for more types of articles. Other improvements could include error handling for network failures, using command-line arguments for input, and adding more metadata to the saved articles. Contributions are welcome!
